Instructions to create blue green analysis resources

Pre-requisites:

curl
kubectl 
connection via kubeconfig to the cluster on which both stable and preview namespaces exist
deployments in both stable and preview namespaces with the full deployment of the application
a working iSD+argo installation in the same cluster, with prometheus, elasticsearch, kibana with ingress for isdui and isd argocd

Steps:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gopaljayanthi/testArgoProj/main/bg-template/start.sh -o start.sh
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

this will download the template files and scripts to create the required files which need to be committed

run
./create.sh <applicationName> <stable-ns> <preview-ns> <isd-ns>

applicationName = usersupplied name, with which a folder is created which needs to be later committed to a github repo, and an argocd application needs to be created
stable-ns: namespace where the stable version of application is running
preview-ns: namespace  where the version being previewed before promoting as stable exists
isd-ns: namespace hwre isd is installed

After the argocd application is created and syched to start an analysis, gt to github repo, to the folder wher ethe code was committed 
and run
./trigger-analysis.sh <namespace-where-the-roloout-was-deployed>
